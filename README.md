# Clustering-DimensionalityReduction
his project involved exploring various clustering algorithms on the Iris dataset. We started by loading and preprocessing the data using StandardScaler and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Then, we applied and evaluated three different clustering methods: K-Means (on both original and PCA-reduced data), Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. We visualized the clusters in 2D and 3D, and assessed the performance of each algorithm by comparing their cluster assignments against the true species labels using confusion matrices, as well as analyzing cluster composition and feature means.
